Repository containing the CIF submission for First Notice of Death v6.3 Cemetery Burial Schedules (CBS) rec Jan 2016.

The FNOD application provides a process by which Program Support Assistants (PSAs) can take actions to establish or update the Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) record upon death of a Veteran or of a Veteran's Spouse (and automatically cancel benefits being provided).FNOD enhancements are needed to reduce or eliminate data entry errors, help users meet performance standards, provide accurate reports, and allow management to review work performance, delegate assignments, and manage overtime.

These enhancements are identified as part of National Cemetery Administration (NCA) collaboration to accommodate the current business process that ensures the data integrity and quality of service historically provided by NCA.  The FNOD enhancements project development will enable users to create records and to store, query, retrieve, print, and update record information. Users will also be able to associate and save one or more document(s) to the record. This will provide time saving workflow and will improve quality of data, a new form of reporting capabilities and user creation of ad-hoc queries.
